### Check Weekly in Google Search Console:
- Total impressions (should increase)
- Total clicks (should increase)
- Average position (should decrease = better)
- Which queries you're appearing for

### Realistic Timeline:
- **Month 1-2:** 100-500 impressions, 5-20 clicks
- **Month 3-4:** 500-2000 impressions, 20-100 clicks

   - Any crawl errors in Search Console?
   - Is robots.txt blocking anything?

**Remember:** Every successful website started with zero traffic. The businesses ranking above you today started just like you. Consistency beats everything - keep creating content, keep getting reviews, keep showing up.

You've got this! 🚀
